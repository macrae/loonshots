## The Innovation Equation

In the book “Loonshots” the author explores how incentive structure affects group behavior.
The hypothesis is that – just like water or traffic – groups of humans have different phase
states dependent more so upon their structure than anything else. Like water freezing at 32
degrees Fahrenheit, a phase shift occurs and groups go from dynamic innovation to stodgy repetition.

The book ends with an equation describing the Magic Number M, the inflection point of this phase change.

The parameters of M are equity (E), fitness (F), management span (S), and salary growth (G).
Note these are not elements of “culture.” They are better described as elements of structure:
organizational design.

As the equation above illustrates, a higher M results from increasing E, S, and F (the parameters
in the numerator), and decreasing G (the denominator).

Parameters E (equity) and S (management span) are usually well enough defined while the parameter F
(fitness) is pretty squishy – the ratio of project skill fit to return on politics. Intuitively,
it is scaling M based on the delta of these two contrasting incentives – 1) how well people are assigned
to empowering work, and 2) how much upside there is to politics and schmoozing.

Putting it all together for our Team, a conservative estimate of M is 20 people.

E = 0.12,  F = 0.67, S = 5.0, G = 0.1 => 20
The inflection point from innovative to political team is 20 people.

What levers do we have available to to move M?

### What-if Analysis 1: AIIP:

Depending upon the perceived value of AIIP we can get a more or less innovative team. That’s why it’s
there! But if people do not perceive the AIIP as having any true value for them – it’s actually harming
our ability to innovate.

All things considered equal, if AIIP starts paying out:

```
For AIIP = 0.0,  M = 20 people
For AIIP = 0.1,  M = 36 people
For AIIP = 0.2,  M = 53 people
For AIIP = 0.3,  M = 70 people
For AIIP = 0.4,  M = 86 people
For AIIP = 0.5,  M = 103 people
```

If every member of the team saw a 10% bump in equity from AIIP – we’d likely be a far more innovative
team – while 20% would put us well over the threshold. If this has any basis in reality, then we need
to design our projects and member contribution in a way that empowers all members of the team to share
in this equity, but there are several risks in our current structure hindering the effect of AIIP on the
group, so for the time being we should assume it as 0.0%.

### What-if Analysis 2: Project Skill Fit (PSF):

It’s a known fact that we have project skill fit issues. From Data Scientists doing (a lot of)
engineering work to pure researchers asked to behave like software developers (w/o training), it’s
been an on-going issue raised in countless leads meetings – there can be large disconnects between
the work we need done and the people we have available to do it. It’s not even a question of if we
have subpar project skill fit or not… we do, the question is: to what extent?

All things considered equal, as our project skill fit increases:

```
ROP = 0.6, PSF = 0.3 => 15 people
ROP = 0.6, PSF = 0.4 => 20 people
ROP = 0.6, PSF = 0.5 => 25 people
ROP = 0.6, PSF = 0.6 => 30 people
ROP = 0.6, PSF = 0.7 => 35 people
```

Assuming some fixed return on politics, ROP* we can see that our ability to innovate increases as
project skill fit (PSF) does. It is hard to say where we actually fall on this spectrum but even
optimistic estimates leave us with a Magic Number in the low twenty’s.

### What-if Analysis 3: Return on Politics (ROP):

Maybe the squishiest of all the parameters of the innovation equation, return on politics.

```
PSF = 0.4, ROP = 0.3, => 40 people
PSF = 0.4, ROP = 0.4, => 30 people
PSF = 0.4, ROP = 0.5, => 24 people
PSF = 0.4, ROP = 0.6, => 20 people
PSF = 0.4, ROP = 0.7, => 17 people
```

Assuming some fixed project skill fit, PSF* we can see that as our ability to innovate decreases as
the return on politics (ROP) increases. Once again, it’s hard to say where we actually fall on this
spectrum but even moderate/average estimates of ROP leaves us with a Magic Number in the twenty’s.

### Conclusion:

Like all models, this is an imperfect attempt to describe some natural phenomena; group behavior. The
exact values of M, PSF or ROP is not the point. This can simply be used to help direct our strategy
towards incentives that effect our ability to innovate, because experimenting with different assumptions,
one thing is clear – if this model has any basis in reality than for a team of our size, M is way less
than it should be.

The three biggest levers available to us are:
- AIIP - needs to payout.
- Project skill fit - needs to improve and we need KPI to measure.
- Return on politics - needs to drop and we need proper review processes up-and-down and side-to-side.

*I assumed a measurement for ROP (return on politics) and PSF (project skill fit) based on some team
survey, with 0.50 an average measure. Intuitively, teams with a greater return on politics have
ROP >0.50 and a lower project skill fit PSF < 0.50.
